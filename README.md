## vodreview

Tool to detect objects in a video. Optimized for longer content (VODs) and generic, everyday objects (e.g., chair, soda can) that fits (roughly) into YOLOv8's labels.

## (WIP) YOLO-World

YOLO-World for more dynamic labels and a more compact pipeline that doesn't need CLIP + YOLO.

Note: YOLO-World does use a CLIP-like text encoder to align prompts with visual features.
